# Blackjack
Python code to implement the famous Blackjack game! The code is compatible with the online Python IDE http://www.codeskulptor.org/ This has a simplegui module which might not be present on your desktop. The ideal substitute would be simpleguitk and don't forget to add the following import: import simpleguitk as simplegui

The rules of the game are not entirely conventional:
- Dealer wins in case of a tie. 
- The scoring is simply +1 (when you win) and -1 (when you lose), though, I intend to introduce betting soon. 
- The player loses if they forfeit the hand. 
Enjoy the game!

Note- This code was submitted by me as a mini-project assignment on a Coursera course "Interactive Programming in Python" by Rice University. If you're taking the same course, I suggest you not to copy-paste my code, rather, write code yourself for then you can actually learn. Thanks!
