# Blackjack
Python code to implement the famous Blackjack game!
The code is compatible with the online Python IDE http://www.codeskulptor.org/
This has a simplegui module which might not be present on your desktop. The ideal substitute would be simpleguitk and don't forget to add the following import:
import simpleguitk as simplegui

The rules of the game are not entirely conventional. For eg: Dealer wins in case of a tie.
The scoring is simply +1 (when you win) and -1 (when you lose), though, I intend to introduce betting soon.
